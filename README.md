This repository contains the code I wrote for the final project of the class Introduction to Web Applications 2023/2024 done at Politecnico di Torino. The final project consisted of coding the website of a house rental agency  in Turin.

Instructions:

There are no specific usage instructions. The application uses HTML, CSS, Jinja, Python 3.11, Flask, Flask-Login, and Bootstrap (version 5.3).
There are no specific dependencies to install other than Flask and Flask-Login.
